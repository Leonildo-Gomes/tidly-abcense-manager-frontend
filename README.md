* **National Calendar**: Integration of Norwegian public holidays for working day calculation.

### 🔄 Module 3: Requests & Approval Workflow

The operational engine connecting employees to managers.

* **Absence Request**: Interface for employees to request dates, with automatic balance validation.
* **Status Flow**: Lifecycle: `PENDING` -> `AUTHORIZED` (Team Leader) -> `APPROVED` (Manager).
